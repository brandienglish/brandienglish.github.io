# About me !

### Hi, my name is Brandi English. I am currently a senior at UAB studying Computer Science and am set to graduate in Spring 2025. I have had an interest in the career paths of Software Engineering and Cyber Security, but I ultimately decided to focus on Cyber Security. I have taken courses such as Computer Security, Cloud Computing/Security, Networking, Database Application Development, and Penetration Testing Fundamentals. Since taking these courses, I have realized how much I enjoy learning about security concepts. To extend my knowledge, I have completed labs and projects outside of school to gain a better understanding of how these concepts work in a real-world environment. Additionally, I am studying for certifications to enhance my expertise. I recently passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and am now preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification.

### I am at the beginning of my cybersecurity career and ready to charge ahead!
